# Contributing

This is a template â€” contributions are welcome. A few guidelines:

- Open small, focused PRs.
- Keep styles and lint rules consistent.
- Update docs in `docs/` when adding features or changing behavior.

If you'd like help integrating this template into your org (CI, deploy, monorepo), open an issue or ping in a PR and include the target environment.
